# essen-basket

Scrapes the basket data from the Essential website.

I wrote this because I'm a member of a food coop (buying group) which orders in bulk from Essential and needs more flexibility than the site itself offers.

You need to hold an account with Essential Trading (www.essential-trading.coop) to be able to use this app. However, it also demonstrates aspx forms login and use of the Clojure enlive library.
